## Welsh Language
Welsh (*Cymraeg* or *y Gymraeg*) is a Celtic language of the Brittonic subgroup that is native to the Welsh people. 
Welsh is spoken natively in Wales by about 18% of the population, by some in England, and in Y Wladfa (the Welsh colony in Chubut Province, Argentina).

The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 gave the Welsh language official status in Wales.
Welsh and English are de jure official languages of the Senedd (the Welsh parliament).

Although modern understanding often splits Welsh into northern (*Gogledd*) and southern (*De*) 'dialects', the traditional classification of four Welsh dialects remains the most academically useful:
+ *Gwyndodeg*, the Gwynedd dialect
+ *Powyseg*, the Powys dialect
+ *Dyfedeg*, the Dyfed dialect
+ *Gwenhwyseg*, the dialect of Gwent and Morgannwg[133]

A fifth dialect is Patagonian Welsh, which has developed since the start of Y Wladfa (the Welsh settlement in Argentina) in 1865; it includes Spanish loanwords and terms for local features, but a survey in the 1970s showed that the language in Patagonia is consistent throughout the lower Chubut Valley and in the Andes.

### The Welsh Dragon (*y Ddraig Goch*, meaning 'the red dragon')
The red dragon is a heraldic symbol which has come to represent Wales.

The military use of the term "dragon" (in Latin, "draco") dates back to the Roman period and this in turn is likely inspired by the symbols of the Scythians, Indians, Persians, Dacians or Parthians.
One notable Draco symbol which may have influenced the Welsh dragon is that of the Sarmatians, who contributed to the cavalry units stationed in Ribchester from the 2nd to 4th centuries.

After the Roman withdrawal it has long been suggested that resistance to the Saxon incursion was led either by Romans or Romanised Britons, and this is evident in the names attributed in legend to those who led the opposition, including Ambrosius Aurelianus and perhaps Artorius. 
This could account for how the Roman terminology came to be adopted by Britons.
From the first extant written records of the Britons, it became evident that dragons were already associated with military leaders. 
Gildas, writing in about 540, spoke of the Briton chieftain Maglocunus (*Maelgwn Gwynedd* in Welsh) as the "*insularis draco*"

The early Welsh poets Taliesin and Aneirin both extensively use dragons as an image for military leaders, and for the Britons the word dragon began to take the form of a term for a war leader, prince or ruler.

The Red Dragon first appears in myth in the ancient *Mabinogion* story of *Lludd and Llefelys* where it is confined, battling with an invading white dragon, at Dinas Emrys. In that story, Lludd confines the dragons at Dinas Emrys.

The tale is taken up in the Historia Brittonum, written by Nennius. 
*Historia Brittonum* was written c. 828, and by this point the dragon was no longer just a military symbol but associated with a coming deliverer from the Saxons. 
In chapters 40–42 there is a narrative in which the tyrant Vortigern flees into Wales to escape the Anglo-Saxon invaders. 
There he chooses a hill-fort as the site for his royal retreat and attempts to build a citadel, but the structure collapses repeatedly. 
A young boy, Emrys (Ambrosius Aurelianus), revels to Vortigern the reason for the collapsing towers: a hidden pool containing two dragons, one red and one white, representing the Britons and the Saxons specifically, buried beneath the foundation. 
He explains how the White Dragon of the Saxons, though winning the battle at present, would soon be defeated by the Welsh Red Dragon. 
After Vortigern's downfall, the fort was given to High-King Ambrosius Aurelianus, known in Welsh as Emrys Wledig, hence the fort's name.
