## Welsh Language
Welsh (*Cymraeg* or *y Gymraeg*) is a Celtic language of the Brittonic subgroup that is native to the Welsh people. 
Welsh is spoken natively in Wales by about 18% of the population, by some in England, and in Y Wladfa (the Welsh colony in Chubut Province, Argentina).

The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 gave the Welsh language official status in Wales.
Welsh and English are de jure official languages of the Senedd (the Welsh parliament).

Although modern understanding often splits Welsh into northern (*Gogledd*) and southern (*De*) 'dialects', the traditional classification of four Welsh dialects remains the most academically useful:
+ *Gwyndodeg*, the Gwynedd dialect
+ *Powyseg*, the Powys dialect
+ *Dyfedeg*, the Dyfed dialect
+ *Gwenhwyseg*, the dialect of Gwent and Morgannwg[133]

A fifth dialect is Patagonian Welsh, which has developed since the start of Y Wladfa (the Welsh settlement in Argentina) in 1865; it includes Spanish loanwords and terms for local features, but a survey in the 1970s showed that the language in Patagonia is consistent throughout the lower Chubut Valley and in the Andes.
