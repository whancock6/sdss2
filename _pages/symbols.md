<center><h2>The Great Seal of the Society</h2></center>
<center><img src="https://whancock6.github.io/sdss2/images/sds-seal.png" style="width: 300px;"></center>

The Seal reveals a lot about the character of St. David (seen in the oval image); 
he has a halo to represent his sainthood and possession of the Holy Spirit, and a crown of crosses to show that Christ ruled his life as his King. 
He is shown playing the harp and serenading the angels with the ancient, national musical instrument of Wales.


The Seal contains the motto of the State of Georgia, the home State of the Society: "_Non Sibi-Sed Aliis_" (or "Not
for ourselves, but for others"). 

It displays the Lion in front of the Cotton Exchange to show it is a Savannah-based Society; 
the Lion of Judah was front and center in St. David's life and the water pouring from its mouth represents the Holy Spirit's baptismal water of life, apropos for Aquaticus, the Saint of life-giving water.
The Cotton Exchange, adorned by classical columns, stands for family and tribal tradition and is marked with the year the Society was established, 2013.

The Great Seal proudly presents the Welsh Dragon, with a stinger-tail to thwart the Romans, Angles, Saxons, Vikings, Normans and any other enemies which have tried to subdue the brave Cymri, 
as well as a "breath of fire" to immolate any would-be conqueror of the Celts; it shows the Dragon's sharp claws digging into the circular orb, gathering the earth to itself, 
representing the diasporic spread of the Welsh across the planet, while always clutching tightly to the inspiring power of Celtic artwork; 
and the mystical wings of flight transporting the Druidic Culture throughout the world.

It has Celtic knotwork to show it emanates from a creative, vibrant, art-loving People; and has the full, legal name of the Society encompassing, in conjunction with Celtic artwork, 
the afore-described themes circumscribed in the inner sanctum of the two circles (heaven & earth) of the Society's Great Seal.

The Membership medal shows a Red Dragon representing Wales adorned by gold artwork to represent royalty of the Tudor Kings and the ancient Cymric jewelers, the envy of the world. The dragon sits on
the ocean with waves (in bluish-green) and spans the sky as well, covering the whole globe - symbolic of the diaspora of the Welsh to all nations of Earth. 

The date, name and Celtic knots are the same as in the Great Seal of the Society, and there is a message (in Weish) inscribed in the lapping waves.
