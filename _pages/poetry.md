>Welsh creativity is unusually disciplined, for since the earliest times the Welsh artistic tradition has been governed by codes and conventions – perhaps since the Druids, relying as they did entirely upon their memories, drew up rules of composition to make it easier for themselves.

>In the Wales of the Independence the Bards and Harpers were institutionalised, with their own allotted places in society, their established functions to perform. They regarded poetry and music as professions, for the practice of which one must qualify, like a lawyer or a doctor.

>There were agreed measurements of value for a work of art, and the subjects of poetry were formalized, consisting at least until the fourteenth century mainly of eulogies and elegies. Musicians were restricted by intricate rules of composition. Poets were governed by the Twenty-Four Strict Metres of the classical Welsh tradition. Among the *Cymry Cymraeg* the Metres still prevail."

In Welsh culture, an *eisteddfod* is an institution and festival with several ranked competitions, including in poetry and music. The term *eisteddfod*, which is formed from the Welsh morphemes: *eistedd*, meaning 'sit', and *fod*, meaning 'be', means, according to Welsh historian and academic Hywel Teifi Edwards, "sitting-together." In his book, *The Eisteddfod*, Edwards further defines the earliest form of the eisteddfod as a competitive meeting between bards and minstrels, in which the winner was chosen by a noble or royal patron.

The Chairing of the Bard (*Cadeirio'r Bardd*) is one of the most important events in the Welsh eisteddfod tradition. The poet who has written the best *awdl*, or poem in strict meter, based on a title chosen by the judges is awarded the bardic chair - literally. 

Here, we use the term to describe the area of our website dedicated to poems, prayers, and songs of import to our members and to our society.
