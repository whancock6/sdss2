David (Welsh: *Dewi Sant*; Latin: *Davidus*; c. 500 – c. 589) was a Welsh Christian prelate who served as Bishop of Mynyw during the 6th century.

David was a native of Wales, and tradition has preserved a large amount of detail about his life, but much of what is "known" about David comes from the writings of Rhygyfarch about 500 years after David's death. 
Rhygyfarch's *Buchedd Dewi* ("Life of David"), a hagiography, claimed to be based on documents found in his cathedral archives. 
Modern historians are sceptical of some of its claims - one of Rhygyfarch's aims was to establish some independence for the Welsh church from Canterbury.

Later writers, such as Giraldus Cambriensis, William of Malmesbury, Geoffrey of Monmouth, John de Tinmouth, and John Capgrave, would all seem to simply copy and enlarge upon the work of Rhygyfarch.

As such, this information below will be a tasteful but impercise mixture of reputable, scholarly work and legend. 

## *Birth*
His birth date is uncertain: most scholars propose a range from 462 to 512. 
He is traditionally believed to be the son of Non and the grandson of Ceredig ap Cunedda, king of Ceredigion, and was said to have been born at Henfynyw (Vetus-Menevia) in Ceredigion.

St. David's birth had been foretold thirty years before by an angel to St. Patrick. 
Prodigies preceded and accompanied the event, and at his baptism at Porth Clais by St. Elvis of Munster, "whom Divine Providence brought over from Ireland at that conjuncture", a blind man was cured by the baptismal water.

## *Life*
The tradition that he was born at in Cardiganshire is not improbable. 
He was prominent at the Synod of Brevi (Llandewi Brefi in Cardiganshire), which has been identified with the important Roman military station, Loventium. 
Shortly afterwards, in 569, he presided over another synod held at a place called Lucus Victoriae. 
He was Bishop (and probably not Archbishop) of Menevia, the Roman port Menapia in Pembrokeshire, later known as St. David's, then the chief point of departure for Ireland.

David's early education was received from St. Illtyd at Caerworgorn (Lanwit major) in Glamorganshire. 
Afterwards he spent ten years studying the Holy Scriptures at Witland in Carmarthenshire, under St. Paulinus, who then sent out the young saint to evangelize the British.

## *Death*
The *Annales Cambriae* (Annals of Wales), said to be derived from writings found at Saint David's cathedral, place his death in 589 AD, though 601 AD is often proposed as an alteranative year. 
The exact date of his death is not certain, but tradition holds that it was on the first of March, which is the date now marked as Saint David's Day. 

*The Welsh Life of St David* by Daniel Simon Evans gives his last words as: 
>"Arglwyddi, brodyr, a chwiorydd, Byddwch lawen a chadwch eich ffyd a'ch credd, a gwnewch y petheu bychain a glywsoch ac y welsoch gennyf i.
>A mwynhau a gerdaf y fford yd aeth an tadeu idi"

which translates as: 
>"Lords, brothers and sisters, Be joyful, and keep your faith and your creed, and do the little things that you have seen me do and heard about.
>And as for me, I will walk the path that our fathers have trod before us."

## Veneration
David was officially recognised at the Holy See by Pope Callixtus II in 1120, thanks to the work of Bernard, Bishop of St David's. David was also canonized by the Eastern Orthodox Church at an unknown date.
