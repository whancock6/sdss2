## Prehistoric Wales 
Prehistoric Wales in terms of human settlements covers the period from about 230,000 years ago, the date attributed to the earliest human remains found in what is now Wales, to the year 48 AD when the Roman armybegan a military campaign against one of the Welsh tribes. 
Traditionally, historians have believed that successive waves of immigrants brought different cultures into the area, largely replacing the previous inhabitants, with the last wave of immigrants being the Celts. 
However, studies of population genetics now suggest that this may not be true, and that immigration was on a smaller scale.

## Wales in the Roman Era
The history of Wales in the Roman era began in CE 48 with a military invasion by the imperial governor of Roman Britain. 
The conquest would be completed by 78, and Roman rule would endure until the region was abandoned in AD 383. 
Once the conquest was complete, the region and the people living there would be a virtually anonymous part of Roman Britain until the Roman departure.
Aside from the many Roman-related discoveries at sites along the southern coast, Roman archaeological remains in Wales consist almost entirely of military roads and fortifications.

## Post-Roman Wales and the Age of the Saints: 411-700
Sub-Roman Britain is a term derived from an archaeological label for the material culture of Britain in Late Antiquity: 
the term "Sub-Roman" was invented to describe the potsherds in sites of the 5th century and the 6th century, initially with an implication of decay of locally-made wares from a higher standard under the Roman Empire. 
It is now often used to denote a period of history. 
Although the culture of Britain in the period was mainly derived from Roman and Celtic sources, there were also Saxons settled as foederati in the area, originally from Saxony in northwestern Germany, although the term 'Saxon' was used by the British for all Germanic incomers. 
Gradually the latter assumed more control (see Anglo-Saxon England). 
The Picts in northern Scotland were also outside the applicable area.

## Early Medieval Wales: 700-1066
Powys as the easternmost of the major kingdoms of Wales came under the most pressure from the English in Cheshire, Shropshire and Herefordshire. 
This kingdom originally extended east into areas now in England, and its ancient capital, Pengwern, has been variously identified as modern Shrewsbury or a site north of Baschurch.
These areas were lost to the kingdom of Mercia. The construction of the earthwork known as Offa's Dyke (usually attributed to Offa, King of Mercia in the 8th century) may have marked an agreed border. 
For a single man to rule the whole country during this period was rare. This is often ascribed to the inheritance system practiced in Wales. 
All sons received an equal share of their father's property (including illegitimate sons), resulting in the division of territories.

## Wales and the Normans: 1067-1283
At the time of the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the dominant ruler in Wales was Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, who was king of Gwynedd and Powys. 
The initial Norman successes were in the south, where William Fitz Osbern overran Gwent before 1070. By 1074 the forces of the Earl of Shrewsbury were ravaging Deheubarth. 
The killing of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn in 1075 led to civil war and gave the Normans an opportunity to seize lands in North Wales. 
In 1081 Gruffudd ap Cynan, who had just won the throne of Gwynedd from Trahaearn ap Caradog at the Battle of Mynydd Carn was enticed to a meeting with the Earl of Chester and Earl of Shrewsbury and promptly seized and imprisoned, leading to the seizure of much of Gwynedd by the Normans.

## Wales and the Late Middle Ages: 1283-1542
Wales in the late Middle Ages spanned the years 1282–1542, beginning with conquest and ending in union.
Those years covered the period involving the closure of Welsh medieval royal houses during the late 13th century, and Wales' final ruler of the House of Aberffraw, the Welsh Prince Llywelyn II, 
also the era of the House of Plantagenet from England, specifically the male line descendants of Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou as an ancestor of one of the Angevin kings of England who would go on to form the House of Tudor from England and Wales.

The House of Tudor would go on to create new borders by incorporating Wales into the Kingdom of England by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542, effectively ever since then new shires had been created in place of castles, by changing the geographical borders of the Kingdoms of Wales to create a new definitions for towns and their surrounding lands. 
Historians referring to the end of the late Middle Ages in Britain often reference the Battle of Bosworth Field involving Henry VII of England, which began a new era in Wales.
